# Fruit-Availability-Index-and-Rainfall-Analysis
This repository contains R scripts and visualization outputs for analyzing the relationship between **rainfall** and **Fruit Availability Index (FAI)**, a crucial ecological measure of food resource availability for frugivorous wildlife such as orangutans.
## Project Overview
Understanding how rainfall affects fruit availability is essential for ecological monitoring, especially in tropical rainforest ecosystems. This project uses statistical methods to explore and visualize the correlation between monthly rainfall and FAI.
## Features
- Data loading from Excel (.xlsx)
- Shapiro-Wilk normality test
- Spearman correlation (non-parametric)
- Scatter plot with regression line
- Export of visualization as PNG
